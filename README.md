# ☀️ Nice Day For Recruiters

Welcome to the lightest, softest corner of my code universe.  
This mini-app was made with one single goal in mind:  
✨ **to make someone’s day a little brighter** — especially yours.

## 💡 The Thought Behind It

> “A piece of code written without purpose is a sad little thing.  
> But a piece of code used to make someone’s day better — that’s the most beautiful kind.”

This project is a gentle digital smile — for the curious recruiter, the detail-oriented reader, or anyone who stumbles across it.

## 🌼 Why?

Because I wanted my CV to do more than list skills.  
I wanted it to **connect**, to **spark joy**, and to show that behind the code, there’s a human who really, truly cares.

If this made you smile even a little, mission accomplished.
